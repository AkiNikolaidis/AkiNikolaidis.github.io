# About Me

I work at the [Child Mind Institute](https://childmind.org/center/center-developing-brain/)., a non-profit devoted to advancing the pace of discovery in child and adolescent mental health. I focus on understanding how to use advanced statistical algorithms to help us better understand the brain's corticostriatal circuits, which are responsible for skill and habit learning.

Most of my work lies at the interface of psychology, education, neuroscience, and statistics.

# Helping the Community

I've been fortunate to work in the Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student and Postdoc Special Interest Group over the past two years. We've been focused on an array of efforts to support graduate students and postdocs in their careers by providing access to mentorship, skills training, and career advice. I've spearheaded an effort to bring more concerted training to young professionals in a range of issues around the #MeToo movement. Specifically we've provided training on a range of issues including strategies to resolve conflict in situations of lower power, consent, micro-aggressions in the worklace, and how to handle unwanted sexualization in the workplace.
